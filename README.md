# multi-agent-video-gen
A multi-agent framework designed for generating culturally accurate videos. It addresses the issues of semantic drift and cultural distortion in general text-to-video models by injecting structured, domain-specific knowledge (focusing on Intangible Cultural Heritage) via a collaborative agent workflow.
